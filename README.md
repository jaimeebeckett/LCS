# JHU Algorithms for Bioinformatics Project 3 - LCS
Design and implement algorithms to solve the longest common subsequence problem.

Compare each of the provided strings to each other and to your test cases. Compare by pairs
only, finding the LCS of the pair. Gaps in matching the substring are allowed.

Count individual comparisons to use as a basis for cost efficiency in terms of the string lengths. If you
want to try timing, please do it in addition to, not instead of, counting comparisons.
A file with required input is provided. The required input is used to demonstrate correctness. You
should supplement this with your own cases that demonstrate correctness in various standard error
situations
